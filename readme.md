The dtab.rex program reads a text file which contains a decision table. 
The format of this file is similar to the format of the input of the **Ccide** decision table format. Only the separation line needs at last the character compination "-|" at least in on place.

The first version is compatible with the **Regina Rexx**, but suitable for any other Rexx version, including mainfram Rexx after minor changes.
